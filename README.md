This is a project undertaken for the UPU to evaluation the Postal Service Sector in the Africa Region
In the pursuit of the UPU to improve the current and future postal service offerings in the Africa region and to enhance the contribution of the region’s postal services to the attainment of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (UN-SDGs), this study has two objectives. Firstly, to identify and categorize the different types of services provided through the postal sector in the Africa region. Secondly, to identify the areas where there are potentials for improvement in the provision of the postal services.
An empirical approach is used to evaluate and analyze the postal services offered via the postal services’ designated operators in the Africa region. Two different structured and semi-structured questionnaires are used to consult the opinions of the designated operators on the services they offer. The gathered data are used to: identify and categorize the services, evaluate the quality of the services, determine the challenges face the improvement of the services.
